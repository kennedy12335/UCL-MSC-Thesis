# UCL MSC Thesis
 
This repository contains the files I used to do my masters project. My master's project involved recognising impacts, and using these impacts to map obstacles in 3D space as well as classify the obstacles based on their materials. 

The few_shot.py file is used to perform few_shot classification to classify the materials. easyfsl is a copy of the repository from https://github.com/sicara/easy-few-shot-learning/tree/master/easyfsl which was used to aid the classification procedure. The robust_id file is used to perform the impact detection algorithm with the threshold.py file containing the function used to calculate the threshold used. 

To download the necessary files, please download the zipped folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11vO7AUibz_8768TRB_X83bF7LhS4PtCk?usp=sharing  and extract it in the root folder of this repository.
